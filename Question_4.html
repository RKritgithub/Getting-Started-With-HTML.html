<!-- Question 4: Write a short note on Tag and element with an example. -->
<!-- Answers: -->
<!-- Tags:
Tag includes a set of characters enclosed in an angular brackets  “<” 
And  “>”. Tags are  used to define beginning and ending of an html document.
It also provide instructions on how content should be displayed.
Tags can be self-closing (eg. <img>) or have opening or closing tag.
Tags are case-insensitive in HTML, meaning you can use uppercase or lowercase letters, but it's a best practice to use lowercase for HTML tags. -->
